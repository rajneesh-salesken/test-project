EC-Council was formed as the result of very disheartening research after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. Founder, Jay Bavisi, after watching the attacks unfold, postured the question, what if a similar attack were to be carried out on the Cyber battlefield? Would the information security community have the tools and resources at their disposal to thwart such an attack? At that time, the answer was no. EC-Council, officially incorporated as the International Council of E-Commerce Consultants was formed to create information security training and certification programs to help the very community our connected economy would rely on to save them from a devastating Cyber Attack. EC-Council rapidly gained the support of top researchers and subject matter experts around the world and launched its first Information Security Program, the Certified Ethical Hacker. With this ever-growing team of subject matter experts and InfoSec researchers, EC-Council continued to build various standards, certifications and training programs in the electronic commerce and information security space.
nternational Council of E-Commerce Consultants, also known as EC-Council, is the world’s largest cyber security technical certification body. We operate in 145 countries globally and we are the owner and developer of the world-famous Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (C|HFI), Certified Security Analyst (ECSA), License Penetration Testing (Practical) programs, among others. We are proud to have trained and certified over 200,000 information security professionals globally that have influenced the cyber security mindset of countless organizations worldwide.

EC-Council
Our certification programs are recognized worldwide and have received endorsements from various government agencies including the US Federal Government via the Montgomery GI Bill, and the US Government National Security Agency (NSA) and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) certifying EC-Council’s Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH), Network Security Administrator (ENSA), Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI), Disaster Recovery Professional (EDRP), Certified Security Analyst (E|CSA) and Licensed Penetration Tester(LPT) program for meeting the 4011, 4012, 4013A, 4014, 4015 and 4016 training standards for information security professionals and most recently EC-Council has received accreditation from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
Why EC-Council

EC-Council has achieved accreditation for its Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH), Certified Chief Information Security Officer (C|CISO), Certified Network Defender (C|ND), and Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (C|HFI), to meet the ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 Personnel Certification Accreditation standard. EC-Council is one of a handful of certification bodies, whose primary specialization is information security, to be awarded this much sought-after quality standard.
Candidates who complete the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH), Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (C|HFI), Certified Network Defender (C|ND), and Certified Chief Information Security Officer (C|CISO) certification will also have that extra credential meeting the requirements of the respective ANSI Certification Training Standards. 
 EC-Council was honored at the 13th Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE) by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) when its Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI), Disaster Recovery Professional (EDRP), Certified Security Analyst (ECSA) and Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT) courseware was certified to have met the 4012 (Senior System Managers), 4013A (System Administrators), 4014 (Information Systems Security Officers), 4015 (Systems Certifiers) and 4016 (Information Security Risk Analyst) training standards for information security professionals in the federal government. The CNSS is a federal government entity under the U.S. Department of Defense that providesprocedures and guidance for the protection of national security systems.
Candidates who complete the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI), Disaster Recovery Professional (EDRP), Certified Security Analyst (ECSA) or Licensed Penetration Tester (LPT) certification will also have that extra credential meeting the requirements of the respective CNSS 4011-4016 Federal Security Certification Training Standards.
EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (C|HFI), and Certified Chief Information Security Officer programs are formally integrated as baseline skill certification options for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) cyber workforce in several categories. Specifically, the C|CISO program is a recognized certification for the DoD IAM Level II, IAM Level III, and CSSP Manager, all specialized cyber management personnel classifications within the DoD’s information assurance workforce. C|HFI is now recognized as a baseline certification for CSSP Incident Responder and C|EH is now required for the DoD’s computer network defenders (CND’s) – CND Analyst, CND Infrastructure Support, CND Incident Responder, and CND Auditor.
EC-Council has achieved accreditation for its Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH), Certified Security Analyst (ECSA), and Chief Information Security Officer (C|CISO), to meet the GCHQ Certified Training standard. This recognition is a feather in the cap for EC-Council’s much sought-after credentials, which are among the most comprehensive programs in the field of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing, and Information Security Leadership.
This affirms EC-Council’s commitment to offering high-quality certification programs that are developed to help arm information security professionals with the right skills to safeguard the cyber world and achieve successful professional roles.
Leading cyber security certification bodies CREST and EC-Council have announced mutual equivalency for their professional entry-point technical qualifications. The direct equivalency relates to the EC-Council Security Analyst (ECSA v10) qualification with the CREST Practitioner Security Analyst (CPSA) qualification. In addition, equivalency can also be granted for the for ECSA (Practical) with the CREST Registered Tester (CRT) certification, provided that the candidate already holds a valid CREST CPSA qualification.
